# ✅ Implementation Complete: Terminal Green Theme + PIN Login + Domain Simplification

Updated on: 2025-08-12

## What’s Done
- Global terminal-inspired green/black theme with JetBrains Mono
- Segmented 6-digit passcode login with auto-advance/paste/autosubmit
- Dashboard polished in dark hacker style; consistent buttons, tables, alerts
- Recent Shortlinks: slug is clickable and opens full short URL in a new tab
- Shortlink JSON includes full_url; UI uses it for correct domain routing
- Domain management feature removed; all new shortlinks use the default domain
- Leftover DomainController and domain UI assets removed
- All test/debug/demo scripts removed
- Docs refreshed and troubleshooting included

## Theme Details (Green Terminal)
- Colors come from CSS variables in `resources/views/layouts/envelope.blade.php`
- Background uses subtle grid + neon green accents
- Focus rings, borders, and badges harmonized with green palette

## Security/Login
- File: `resources/views/panel/login.blade.php`
- 6 input boxes; numeric-only; paste distributes; hidden `name="pin"`
- Backend validation unchanged: `digits:6`, reads `config('panel.pin')`

## Shortlinks UX
- File: `resources/views/panel/shortlinks.blade.php`
- Slug cell renders as `<a class="link-slug" href="{full_url}" target="_blank">{slug}</a>`
- Hover state improves affordance
- Create form auto-adds https:// if missing; shows success checkmark; notifications

## Domain Logic Simplified
- Model `Shortlink@getFullUrlAttribute()` always uses `Domain::getDefault()` when building the URL, with fallback to `APP_URL`
- Shortlink creation no longer accepts or stores a domain selection
- UI for domain management removed; routes removed
- Deleted: DomainController.php and domains view

## Files Touched
- Views: `layouts/envelope.blade.php`, `panel/login.blade.php`, `panel/shortlinks.blade.php`
- Controllers: `PanelAuthController.php`, `ShortlinkController.php`
- Models: `Shortlink.php`, `Domain.php`
- Routes: `routes/web.php` (clean domain routes; panel routes intact)
- Docs: `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`, `DOMAIN_SETUP_TUTORIAL.md`

## Cleanup
- Removed all test/debug/demo scripts and any domain management artifacts
- Cleared Laravel cache/view cache after major changes

## Final Polish Checklist
- [x] Theme consistency across all pages (buttons, forms, tables, alerts)
- [x] Slug links open in new tab and use correct domain
- [x] Removed domain add/manage UI and controller
- [x] PIN login UX smooth on desktop and mobile
- [x] Replace stray blue focus ring with green in forms

## How to Test Quickly
1) php artisan serve
2) Visit /panel/login and try the segmented PIN
3) In /panel/shortlinks create a link; click slug to open target

Everything is aligned with the requested terminal-green, cyberpunk-inspired style and simplified domain behavior.
