# ✅ Implementation Complete: Terminal Green Theme + PIN Login + Domain Simplification + Link Rotator

Updated on: 2025-08-19

## What's Done
- Global terminal-inspired green/black theme with JetBrains Mono
- Segmented 6-digit passcode login with auto-advance/paste/autosubmit
- Dashboard polished in dark hacker style; consistent buttons, tables, alerts
- Recent Shortlinks: slug is clickable and opens full short URL in a new tab
- Shortlink JSON includes full_url; UI uses it for correct domain routing
- Domain management feature removed; all new shortlinks use the default domain
- **NEW: Advanced Link Rotator System with multiple destinations per shortlink**
- Leftover DomainController and domain UI assets removed
- All test/debug/demo scripts removed
- Docs refreshed and troubleshooting included

## Link Rotator Features
- **Multiple Destinations**: Add unlimited URLs to one shortlink
- **Rotation Strategies**:
  - Random: Each click goes to a random destination
  - Sequential: Round-robin through destinations in order
  - Weighted: Distribution based on assigned weights (1-100)
- **Smart Management**: Toggle between single link and rotator modes
- **Real-time Updates**: Manage destinations without recreating shortlinks
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear badges and info for rotator links in dashboard

## Theme Details (Green Terminal)
- Colors come from CSS variables in `resources/views/layouts/envelope.blade.php`
- Background uses subtle grid + neon green accents
- Focus rings, borders, and badges harmonized with green paletteComplete: Terminal Green Theme + PIN Login + Domain Simplification

## Theme Details (Green Terminal)
- Colors come from CSS variables in `resources/views/layouts/envelope.blade.php`
- Background uses subtle grid + neon green accents
- Focus rings, borders, and badges harmonized with green palette

## Security/Login
- File: `resources/views/panel/login.blade.php`
- 6 input boxes; numeric-only; paste distributes; hidden `name="pin"`
- Backend validation unchanged: `digits:6`, reads `config('panel.pin')`

## Shortlinks UX
- File: `resources/views/panel/shortlinks.blade.php`
- Slug cell renders as `<a class="link-slug" href="{full_url}" target="_blank">{slug}</a>`
- Hover state improves affordance
- Create form auto-adds https:// if missing; shows success checkmark; notifications
- **Link Type Toggle**: Choose between single destination or rotator mode
- **Rotator Management**: Modal interface for managing multiple destinations
- **Visual Indicators**: Rotator badges show destination count and rotation type

## Rotator Technical Details
- Model: `Shortlink@getNextDestination()` handles rotation logic
- Database: New columns `is_rotator`, `rotation_type`, `destinations`, `current_index`
- Controller: Enhanced validation for rotator data and destination management
- API: New endpoints `/api/rotator/{slug}` for GET/PUT operations
- JavaScript: Complete UI for managing destinations with real-time validation

## Domain Logic Simplified
- Model `Shortlink@getFullUrlAttribute()` always uses `Domain::getDefault()` when building the URL, with fallback to `APP_URL`
- Shortlink creation no longer accepts or stores a domain selection
- UI for domain management removed; routes removed
- Deleted: DomainController.php and domains view

## Files Touched
- Database: `2025_08_19_000001_add_rotation_to_shortlinks.php` migration
- Views: `layouts/envelope.blade.php`, `panel/login.blade.php`, `panel/shortlinks.blade.php`
- Controllers: `PanelAuthController.php`, `ShortlinkController.php` (enhanced with rotator methods)
- Models: `Shortlink.php` (added rotation logic), `Domain.php`
- Routes: `routes/web.php` (added rotator API endpoints)
- Config: `config/panel.php` (added domain fallback options)
- Docs: `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`, `DOMAIN_SETUP_TUTORIAL.md`

## Cleanup
- Removed all test/debug/demo scripts and any domain management artifacts
- Cleared Laravel cache/view cache after major changes

## Final Polish Checklist
- [x] Theme consistency across all pages (buttons, forms, tables, alerts)
- [x] Slug links open in new tab and use correct domain
- [x] Removed domain add/manage UI and controller
- [x] PIN login UX smooth on desktop and mobile
- [x] Replace stray blue focus ring with green in forms
- [x] Link rotator with unlimited destinations per shortlink
- [x] Three rotation strategies: random, sequential, weighted
- [x] Modal interface for managing rotator destinations
- [x] Visual indicators for rotator vs single links

## How to Test Quickly
1) php artisan serve
2) Visit /panel/login and try the segmented PIN
3) In /panel/shortlinks create a regular link; click slug to open target
4) Create a rotator link: toggle "Link Rotator", add multiple URLs, set rotation type
5) Test rotator: click the slug multiple times to see different destinations
6) Manage rotator: click ⚙️ button on rotator links to edit destinations

## Link Rotator Usage Examples
- **A/B Testing**: Random rotation between landing pages
- **Load Balancing**: Sequential distribution across multiple servers
- **Affiliate Marketing**: Weighted rotation based on commission rates
- **Geographic Routing**: Different URLs for different regions
- **Seasonal Campaigns**: Rotate between current and upcoming promotions

Everything is aligned with the requested terminal-green, cyberpunk-inspired style, simplified domain behavior, and advanced link rotation capabilities for unlimited destinations per shortlink.
